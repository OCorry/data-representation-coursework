# Data Representation Coursework
</br>

## Introduction

This repository contains continious assessment coursework for the *Data Representation* module as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics course at [ATU Galway](https://www.atu.ie/about-atu/campus-locations/atu-galway-city). 
</br>

## Contents of this Repository:
This repository contains the following:

1. **<ins>Assignments Folder</ins>**

    - **assignment01-Library.xml** - create an XML file that contains a library of two catalogues (technical books and cookery) and within those two catalogues, there are two books.

    - **assignment03-cso.py** - A program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series) from the CSO,and stores it into a file called *cso.json*. To make the data more readable in the *cso.json* file press ``alt + shift + f``.

    - **assignment04-github.py** - A program that reads in a file from a private repository. The program replaces all the instances of the text "Andrew" with my name (Orla). Lastly, The program then commits those changes and pushes the updated file back to the repository. As this is a private repository, an *API Key* is needed to access the file. This key is stored in the *config2.py* file which in turn is stored in the *.gitignore* file so that it is not pushed up to GitHub.
</br>

2. **<ins>Labs Folder</ins>**

This folder contains some of the labs completed throughout the semester.
